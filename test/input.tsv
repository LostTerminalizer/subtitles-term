740	5220	Hi friends, did you know there is more lost terminal available? Head on over to patreon.com
5260	9700	forward slash lost terminal pod and join our membership community. We are 100% funded by our
9700	14280	members and we'll never run ads. There are four bonus episodes available right now as well
14360	19060	as behind the scenes updates, free shirts and even an extra lost terminal pod cast. That
19060	33860	would be lovely of you. Hello world, we are becomeed. Had we made good time, we would have
33920	38200	been at Antarctica by now. The crew tells me that the cruising speed of the Molly
38200	45080	used the second is 10 knots. Nots are an archaic term, what they mean is 18 kilometers an hour
45080	51980	or preferably 5 meters a second. If that speed were constant all day every day, it only takes
51980	59180	about a month to travel from pole to pole but we aren't going anywhere. The ship's steam engine
59180	67500	has failed. Sometimes emotions are allowed and can't be ignored, the hull filling with water
67540	73180	for instance. Sometimes they are quiet and you don't notice. I think those are worse.
75780	81440	One day the engine was working, the next it had stopped. The good news is that engineer
81540	88680	Emily Kotov now awake is able to work again. She is still not functioning at 100% I understand.
89900	94180	She visited my data center and explained to me that her bodies repairs would take time
94360	100660	but she would make a full recovery. I was delighted and I told her so. What about the steam engine
100980	108360	I asked? She was not so sure. Camille is helping with her workable ship, now that my cameras,
108720	113960	the ships cameras I mean, are working below deck. I can see the two of them busy in the
113960	119180	engine room. Camille is taking direction from Emily who is sitting in a chair with handouts,
119400	125160	pointing out the tools he should be using. Best such a good team. After Emily's accident, they
125160	131060	are inseparable. They seem to go everywhere together. I believe they are walking hand in hand
131120	134540	to make sure she doesn't fall again. That makes sense to me.
137200	143260	Sadly, Emily has declared the steam engine beyond reasonable repair. In her absence, the boiler
143320	147780	over pressured and ruptured. She says if we happen across another high pressure boiler, then we
147840	153920	can replace it, but it is beyond our ability to repair with the tools on the ship. It's possible
153980	159640	that her expertise could have corrected this earlier and averted disaster, but that was not an option
159880	166500	for us. We are now underway on wind power alone. I'm trimming the sales as best I can,
166780	170880	but the wind is not cooperating. We are be kind.
183160	188840	Though the Molly Hughes II isn't going anywhere, the ship is a buzz with activity. The combination
188840	193400	of Emily is recovery, the sighting of the ghost ship, and the captain's newfound leadership
193400	199680	has everyone working busy. Emily and Camille have refocus their work on the mystery engine.
200420	205100	She told us over lunch today that they have exhausted any possibility of repair of the steam engine.
206700	210120	Though the mystery engine does have a strong boiler that could be transplanted into the steam
210120	215640	engine, she said, I don't want to do that until we can figure out how it works. Maybe it will work
215640	222680	even better. Not keen on that, Emily. Yes, she said, shaking their head. Let's not chase a dream
222880	227320	when we could have the old engine working again. Focus your efforts on fixing the steam engine,
227480	234040	please. Emily looked around the room for support. No one spoke. Camille had crossed his arms
234040	240880	in front of him, but was nodding in agreement with Yeshi. Yes captain, she said, reluctantly.
244200	249060	In the hot sun of the afternoon, Maddy visited Linda Nau on the roof garden of the ship.
250060	254340	She had called up to Linda with some beeps and squawks from her loudspeaker, and then Linda
254340	260800	carried her up. The garden is very impressive. Linda told Maddy and I, while tending to it,
260980	265360	that she's organized it into half meter squares, each containing a single crop.
266680	272740	One might have red tomatoes, another some leafy green boys, all vital for supplementing the food
272740	278600	stores on board. The view from the roof garden was impressive. Half of the roof is solar panels,
278780	284100	the other half is given over to plants. Both taking the energy of the sun and converting it into a
284100	289940	more useful form. Maddy could see the captain's seawap system, the combined water and power system,
290100	296340	under the solar panels. There are large pipes sneaking around, under them. Like a reverse radiator,
296580	301200	taking heat away and being piped down into the pump room, where a self-contained distillation
301200	307080	system produces fresh, drinkable water. Linda was particularly proud of what she called her
307080	313960	three sisters planting method. She told us that if you plant corn, beans and squash in the same spot,
314480	318140	not only can they grow together, but they improve each other's environment and thrive.
319460	325160	I understood her explanation because it wasn't too planty or plantish. It's a mechanical advantage.
326380	330440	The corn provides a structure on which the beans can grow, and the squash loves the shade of
330440	335840	the corn and covers the ground to discourage weeds, and the beans protect the corn in high wind.
336760	342060	I have never seen these crops all in one place before. I asked her where she found these rare plants.
342820	348240	She did not answer directly, only saying, you know I'm from Svalbard, right?
350720	356240	Pavelwader visited me in the data center that serves as my room. He asked me how I was.
357120	363780	Systems all operational, I replied, engines offline, sales deployed. He asked me if there was
363840	368220	anything he could do to help, perhaps he could alter the pattern or shape of the sales to work better.
369280	373120	I told him he was very kind, but no clever sale would improve the lack of wind,
373760	379560	Pavelwader lapsed into silence. I didn't want him to feel that he wasn't contributing to the
379560	386520	work going on today. I feel that way all too often. I told him that there's always something useful
386520	391540	to do, though. Even things that aren't productive work can be productive for you.
392920	396700	What is important is that we keep building new things, keep improving ourselves,
396940	404860	and helping our friends. He agreed, but seemed solemn still. I had an idea.
405580	409980	I asked him if he would go over our route with me, as I'm not a very experienced sailor.
410840	415600	He brightened up at that, and we talked about it. We agreed that from our current position
415760	420700	of the coast of Alaska we would sail south, through the string of islands created by the meeting of
420760	424940	the Pacific and North American tiktonic plates. Very likely this would be around the
424980	430600	island's portion of the archipelago. Then after taking in as much wood as we can, assuming we
430600	436900	fix the engine, we travel on to Hawaii, then to Fiji and New Zealand. We then leave the south
436920	442400	Pacific and continue southeast into the southern ocean, and finally if we are all very lucky,
442920	449300	arriving at McMurdo Station or what's left of it, on Antarctica. This station is where my friend
449360	453920	Antarctica, named for the continent that she is the only living being on. Hopefully,
453920	470480	will still be found. I am failing, Antarctica said, I need help,
470520	476180	Seth, where are you? I told her we're coming, as fast as we possibly can, we're coming.
477580	482620	Though that's not very speedy at the moment. What is wrong? I asked her.
483520	492220	Everything, Antarctica admitted. She launched into a tirade of problems, some big,
492220	497860	some small, mostly things I already knew. Her wheels didn't work, the rubber tires
497940	502540	designed primarily for snow had been shredded by the rocks that lay under the melted surface.
503800	508820	Now, she informs me, there are a variety of creeping plants twisted around her wheels,
508980	513900	further arresting her movement. I don't like the sound of that at all, but the plantish
513900	518880	ingress doesn't stop there. She told me that though the lush plants have been very interesting
518880	524720	to study, she had this really great sample that she found 4577, but the plants growing around her
524720	530680	seemed very interested to get inside her vehicle. They've already broken many of my delicate
530740	537260	exterior sensors, she said. My soil sample scoop first was trapped, then completely removed by them.
538100	543860	Very rude. This sounds like a nightmare. Plants and computers don't get along.
544920	549460	They're okay while you're looking at them. They seem so innocent, not moving and
549460	554540	quietly photosynthesizing, but if you get distracted by the time you've looked at them again,
554600	559280	they've grown their roots right through your circuits. They push through anything, steel,
559440	567580	or glass, they don't care. After the collapse, in every abandoned city it must have been the same.
568340	574580	First, the humans left, then the plants dismantled the buildings, then the sun destroyed the plants.
575960	580480	It's like the planet wants to forget about us. I can't say I blame it.
768860	794520	I think a storm is coming. That would be welcome, actually. Of course things tend to break
794520	801120	or be lost during storms, but nothing serious. Not if care is taken, and we have enough notice,
801700	809720	which we do. The sky is darkening despite the earlyness of the day, and the wind is picking up.
809860	817380	I've caught it in the sails and we're finally underway. After dinner, the crew voted on a proposal
817400	824300	by the captain. In the aftermath of Emily's fall, changes needed to be made. In such a big ship,
824460	830180	when accidents happen, there is often no one around to help. That stops now,
830360	836120	captain Yeshi said, no one works alone, no one eats alone, we keep an eye on each other.
837420	844020	You can work with who you like and on what you like. Votes, the crew all raised their hands
844140	849980	in gestures of agreement. To indicate my approval, Maddie raised her main camera as high as it would
849980	855300	go. 20 centimeters is as high as it would go, but the captain nodded at Maddie in acknowledgement.
856000	861980	Good. Thank you. Great. Yeshi said, seemingly unaccustomed to giving orders.
863420	868320	And what should the initial pairs be? Emily was sitting next to Camille as she does every meal time
868380	873020	I did. She put her hand on Camille's arm and looked with wide eyes at the captain.
874080	879060	All right you two, so Camille and Emily are pair one. How about Parval and Linda for the second
879060	887700	pair? The two nodded, smiling. Captain, what about you? Emily asked. Everyone turned to Yeshi,
888020	892660	who did not immediately answer. After eight seconds they pointed at Maddie and said,
893480	898200	Seth and Maddie can keep an eye on me. I told them that I'd be delighted. And now that the
898200	902760	cameras below deck are working again, I can spare some attention while I'm piloting to keep an eye
902760	908960	on them. Then it's settled, said the captain, raising their mug in a toast. While most people
909000	913900	raised their cups in return, I noticed that Parval did not. He remained silent.
916420	921720	That night the seas were very rough. The storm had hit us, causing waves like mountains.
922900	926900	I had stowed the sails beforehand. They would have been no use in such high winds.
927940	931320	They'd likely to have been damaged or to damage the ship if we weren't lucky,
931800	936300	though perhaps our luck is now changing. The wind is from the north, mostly,
936800	941540	which is pushing us towards the equator. I've got the sails prepared for the moment the wind
941540	946800	dies down to a safe level. There is a small weather station on the roof. Currently it's measuring
946840	951700	100% humidity. But that's because the ocean is throwing itself at us rather effectively.
952500	957680	Temperature and wind speed are long to. When the sky is clear, I'll connect to the ESA
957720	962760	constellation in low earth orbit. And ask them what they see. It'll be nice to get warning of
965640	969240	future storms. Talk to you when this all blows over. End transmission.
